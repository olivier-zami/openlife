1.  Use fast computer to ensure 60 fps during audio recording

2.  Start audio recording.

2b. Launch game and make POP sound as soon as character is visible, then
    rest for a second and prepare to live-act the video.
 
2c. Move around world and talk live into mic.  Trim resulting audio at POP 
    compress/normalize/cleanup, and save as mono AIFF test.aiff.  Also convert
    to stereo as testStereo.wav 

3.  Switch on white background in makeAndView and then run it to test sync.

4.  Switch back to transparent background in makeAndView and run it one more 
    time.

5.  Run genMouthShapes on resulting audio like this (see makeAndView):

./genMouthShapes  test2.aiff  60 6 0.05 mouthShapes out mouthFrameList.txt 

6.  Copy mouthShapes folder and mouthFrameList into gameSource folder.

7.  Enable drawMouths and frame output in animation bank and rebuild game.

8.  Copy recoded game file into playback folder.

9.  Set blendOutputPairs and blendOutputFrameFraction setting.  No need to set 
    outputFrames setting (frame output starts automatically due to 7.)

9b.  Run and disable onscreen display during playback.  Frames output.

10. Save mono AIFF as a stereo WAV file.

11. Merge resulting frames with audio into a movie (see makeX264VideoTest)
    to test.

12. Convert frames to png for lightworks:
    mogrify -monitor -format png frame0*.tga

13. Load frames and audio into Lightworks and test.


Next:  In-game audio recording

14. Disable drawMouths in animation bank.

15. Enable recordAudio setting and set recordAudioLengthInSeconds setting.

16. Run game again for another playback to output audio.

17. Converted recordedAudio.aiff in Audacity to make it compatible with 
    LightWorks (not sure what the problem is here).

18. Load resulting audio in Lightworks and sync it.
